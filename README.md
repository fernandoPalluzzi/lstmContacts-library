# lstmContacts-library

The **lstmContacts** software characterizes and draws atigen-antibody interaction profiles based on a library of known contacts. The software has two main modules: the contact similarity search module (R module) and the prediction module, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (Python module). The R module takes the input antigen-antibody complex and generates an affinity contact library that can be used by the LSTM module for the refinement/prediction of an interaction time series.

# Patenting notice

The **lstmContact** library is temporarily moved to a private repository due to patenting procedures. It will revert to public as soon as possible.
